			h1 I love books
			p I am Lisa and I love to read. I decided to make my library accessible to everyone, because I get a lot of questions about the books I have, have read or recommend.
			p My love for book all started at a very young age. My mother works at a library, so as a child I had access to a lot of books. I grew up with all these fantastic worlds right there for me to explore!

				| People ask me very often 
				strong which genre I like the most
				| , but that differs a lot. Some periods of time I am really into Young Adult/fantasy, but other times I read a lot of thrillers. During the summer I like chicklits more. Luckily, this also means that I have a lot of different genres available for my friends and family!
